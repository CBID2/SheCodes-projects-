## Overview

### The challenge

- Create a landing page from scratch about something youâ€™re passionate about. The page should include a user interaction.

## My process
### Built with 

- Basic HTML 
- Basic CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript




### What I learned

Through this project, I have learned the following:

1. "target="_blank"> 
```html
<footer>
<p class="books-footer">This page was built by <a class="books-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinebelzie/"target="_blank"> <em>Christine Belzie</em></a></p>
</footer>
```
2. linear-gradient 
```
body {
  background: linear-gradient(to top, #fff1eb 0%, #ace0f9 100%)
  }
```
3. alert 
```

  if (age >=16){
  alert("Welcome to the club" + name + "! Stay tuned for more updates! ");
  }else{
    alert(" Sorry kiddo! Better luck next year. ")
  }
  }
```





### Continued development

As someone who is fairly new to coding, I want to improve on the following:

1. HTML: Semantic tags, improve on writing classes, using the div tag to create containers. 
2. CSS: Making background containers appear
3. JavaScript: Gain a better understanding of the basics.   



### Useful resources

- [SheCodes' CSS gradients](https://gradients.shecodes.io/) - This helped me for create the background colors of my landing page. I really liked this source and will use it going forward. I also recommend this tool for those who are new to CSS.  
- [Landing Page tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-a-landing-page-with-html-css-and-javascript/) - This article helped gave me some ideas on how to go about creating a landing page. I'd recommend it to anyone who struggling to build this kind of project.
